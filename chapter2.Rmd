# Analysis
*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*

Let's get the data. if you want to know more about the data, please read the manual webpage about it with this [link](http://www.helsinki.fi/~kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-meta.txt)
```{r} 
our_data = read.table("/Users/cem/Desktop/IODS-project/learning2014.txt", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
#checking the dimentions of the data
dim(our_data)
#our data has 166 row and 7 columns

#checking the structure of the data
str(our_data)
# we can see the variable names and values of each samples. 7 total variable and 166 samples are there. 
```
```{r} 
#we will create graphical overview of the data, we need library. so we are calling libraries.

library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
# graphical overview creting codes.
p <- ggpairs(our_data, mapping = aes(col=gender,alpha = 0.3), lower = list(combo = wrap("facethist", bins = 20)))
p

#here we can see correlation of each variables.
```

```{r} 
qplot(attitude, Points, data = our_data) + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
my_model <- lm(Points ~ attitude, data = our_data)
summary(my_model)

```
